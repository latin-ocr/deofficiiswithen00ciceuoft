life and fond of warfare. But if we will face the
facts, we shall find that there have been many
instanees of achievement in peace more important
and no less renowned than in war.

However highly Themistocles, for example, may Themistocles

be extolled—and deservedly—and however much
more illustrious his name may be than Solon’s, and

however much Salamis may be cited as witness' of

his most glorious victory—a victory glorified above
Solon’s statesmanship in instituting the Areopagus

; ——yet Solon's achievement is not to be accounted less

- the state once and only once; while Solon’s work
f will be of service for ever. For through his legisla-

tion the laws of the Athenians and the institutions
of their fathers are maintained. And while The-
mistocles could not readily point to any instance in
which he himself had rendered assistance to the
Areopagus, the Areopagus might with justice assert
that Themistocles had received assistance from it;
for the war was directed by the counsels of that
senate which Solon had created.

The same may be said of Pausanias and Lysander.

are not even remotely to be compared with the
legislation and discipline of Lycurgus. Nay, rather,

’ it was due to these that Pausanias and Lysander had
’ armies so brave and so well disciplined. For my own

, part, I do not consider that Marcus Scaurus was inferior

to Gnaeus Pompey, when I was engaged in public
life. For arms are of little value in the field unless
there is wise counsel at home. So, too, Africanus,
