ciple, then, that what is morally wrong can never be
expedient—not even when one secures by means of
it that which one thinks expedient; for the mere
act of thinking a course expedient, when it is morally

wrong, is demoralizing. But, as I said above, cases Expediency

often arise in which expediency may seem to clash

carefully and see whether their conflict is inevitable
or whether they may be reconciled. The following
are problems of this sort: suppose, for example, a
time of dearth and famine at Rhodes, with provisions
at fabulous prices ; and suppose that an honest man
has imported a large cargo of grain from Alexandria
and that to his certain knowledge also several other
importers have set sail from Alexandria, and that on
the voyage he has sighted their vessels laden with
grain and bound for Rhodes3 is he to report the fact
to the Rhodians or is he to keep his own counsel
and sell his own stock at the highest market price?
1 am assuming the case of a virtuous, upright man,
and I am raising the question how a man would
think and reason who would not conceal the facts
from the Rhodians if he thought that it was immoral
to do so, but who might be in doubt whether such
silence would really be immoral.
