BOOK I. ii-iii

schools should claim to be consistent, they could not
say anything about duty3 and no fixed, invariable,
natural rules of duty can be posited except by those
who say that moral goodness is worth secking solely
or chiefly for its own sake. Accordingly, the teach-
ing of ethics is the peculiar right of the Stoics, the
Academicians, and the Peripatetics3 for the theories
of Aristo, Pyrrho, and Erillus have been long since
rejected; and yet they would have the right to dis·
cuss duty if they had lest us any power of choosing
between things, so that there might be a way of
finding out what duty is. I shall, therefore, at this
time and in this investigation follow chiefly the
StoicS, not as a translator, but, as is my custom, I
shall at my own option and discretion draw from
those sources in such measure and in such manner
as shall suit my purpose.

Since, therefore, the whole discussion is to be on
the subject of duty, I should like at the outset to
define what duty is, as, to my surprise, Panaetius has
failed to do. For every systematic development of any
subject ought to begin with a definition, so that every
one may understand what the discussion is about.

ΙΙΙ. Every treatise on duty has two parts ι one, deal· classification
ing with the doctrine of the supreme good ; the other, ⁰¹ dune&
with the practical rules by which daily life in all its
bearings may be regulated. The following questions
are illustrative of the first part: whether all duties
are absolute3 whether one duty is more important
than another; and so on. But as regards special
duties for which positive rules are laid down, though
they are affected by the doctrine of the supreme
good, still the fact is not so obvious, because they
seem rather to look to the regulation of every-day
