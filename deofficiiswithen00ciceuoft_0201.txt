Let us now proceed to the task in hand.

ΙΙΙ. Five principles, accordingly, have been laid
down for the pursuance of duty: two of them have to
do with propriety and moral rectitude3 two, with the
external conveniences of life—means, wealth, influ-
ence3 the'fifth, with the proper choice, if ever the
four first mentioned seem to be in conflict. The
division treating of moral rectitude, then, has been
completed, and this is the part with which I desire
you to be most familiar.

The principle with which we are now dealing is
that one which is called Expediency. The usage
of this word has been corrupted and perverted and
has gradually come to the point where, separating
moral rectitude from expediency, it is accepted that
a thing may be morally right without being expedi-
ent, and expedient without being morally right. No
more pernicious doctrine th'an this could be intro-
duced into human life.

There are, to be sure, philosophers of the very
highest reputation who distinguish theoretically be-
tween these three conceptions,1 although they are
indissolubly blended together3 and they do this, I

. assume, on moral, conscientious principles. [For

whatever is just, they hold, is also expedient3 and in
like manner, whatever is morally right is also just. It
follows, then, that whatever is morally right, is also
expedient] Those who fail to comprehend that

² That is, they make a false distinction between (1) moral
rectitude that is at the same time expedient; (2) moral
rectitude that is (apparently) not expedient; and (3) the
expedient that is (apparently) not moi-ally right.
