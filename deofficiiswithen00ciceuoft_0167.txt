BOOK I. xxxix

house, not the house to its owner. And, as in
everything else a man must have regard not for
himself alone but for others also, so in the home of
a distinguished man, in which numerous guests must
be entertained and crowds of every sort of people
received, care must be taken to have it spacious.
But if it is not frequented by visitors, if it has an
air of lonesomeness, a spacious palace often becomes
a discredit to its owner. This is sure to be the
case if at some other time, when it had a different
owner, it used to be thronged. For it is unpleasant,
when passers-by remark:

“ Ο good old house, alas! how different
The owner who now owneth thee!’'

And 11} these times that may be said of many a
house!

One must be careful, too, not to go beyond
proper bounds in expense and display, especially
if one is building for oneself. For much mischief
is done in this way, if only in the example set.
For many people imitate zealously the foibles of
the great, particularly in this direction: for example,
who copies the virtues of Lucius Lucullus, excel-
lent man that he was? But how many there are who
have copied the magnificence of his villas! Some
limit should surely be set to this tendency and it
should be reduced at least to a standard of modera-
tion3 and by that same standard of moderation the
comforts and wants of life generally should be regu-
lated.

· But enough on this part of my theme.

'Members of Caesar’s party were now occupying the
houses that had been the homes of Pompey's friends
Antony, for example, lived in Pompey's house.
