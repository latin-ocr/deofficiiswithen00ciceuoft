BOOK ΙΙ. xxii

had other and greater virtues. The boast of official
integrity belongs not to that man alone but also to
his times. When Paulus got possession of all the
wealth ofMacedon———and it was enormous—he brought
into our treasury so much money ὅ that the spoils of a
single general did away with the need for a tax on
property in Rome for all time to come. But to his
own house he brought nothing save the glory of an
immortal name. Africanus emulated his father's
example and was none the richer for his overthrow
of Carthage. And what shall we say of Lucius
Mummius, his colleague in the censorship? Was he
one penny the richer when he had destroyed to its
foundations the riehest of cities? He preferred to
adorn Italy rather than his own house. And yet by
the adornment of Italy his own house was, as it
seems to me, still more splendidly adorned.

There is, then, to bring the discussion back to the Integrity
point from which it digressed‚ no vice more offensive
than avarice, especially in men who stand foremost
and hold the helm of state. For to exploit the state
for selfish profit is not only immora13 it is criminal,
infamous. And so the oracle, which the Pythian
Apollo uttered, that‘ Sparta should not fall from any
other cause than avarice,y ’seems to be a prophecy
not to the Lacedaemonians alone, but to all wealthy
nations as well. They who direct the affairs of
state, then, can win the good-will of the masses by
no other means more easily than by self- restraint
and self- denial.

But they who pose as friends of the people, and The me ace ος
