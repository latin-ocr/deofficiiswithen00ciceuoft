Hence there is ι Um en field for orators on the sub-

Their passion for military glory, moreover, is shown
in the fact that we see their statues usually in
soldier's garb.

XIX. But if the exaltation of spirit seen in times
of {flanger and toil is devoid of justice and fights for
sdfish ends instead of for the common good, it is a
qice3 for not only has it no clement of virtue, but
ᾖε nature is barbarous and revolting to all our finer
‘feelings The Stoics, therefore, correctly define
courage as “that virtue which champions the cause
of right.” Accordingly, no one has attained to true
glory who has gained a reputation for courage by
treachery and cunning3 for nothing that lacks justice
can be morally right.

This, then, is a fine saying of Plato’s: “Not only
must all knowledge that is divorced from justice be
ἶ called cunning rather than wisdom,'' he says, “but
even the courage that is prompt to face danger, if it
is inspired not by public spirit, but by its own selfish
’ purposes, should have the name of effrontery rather
than of courage.'' And so we demand that men
who are courageous and high-souled shall at the
same time be good and straightforward, lovers of
truth, and foes to deception; for these qualities are

’ the centre and soul of justice. 6

Fortitude in the
