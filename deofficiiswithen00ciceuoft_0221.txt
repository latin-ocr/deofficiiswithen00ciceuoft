cause, made an even more shameful use of victory;
for he did not stop at confiscating the property 01

provinces and countries in one common ban of ruin.
And so, when foreign nations had been oppressed
and ruined, we have seen a model of Marseilles carried
in a triumphal procession, to serve as proof to the world
that the supremacy of the people had been forfeited3
and that triumph we saw celebrated over a city with-
