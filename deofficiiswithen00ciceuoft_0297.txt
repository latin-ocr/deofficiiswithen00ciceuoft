my leisure is forced upon me by want of public ⁹5¹2? ἓξὲξ·
business, not prompted by any desire for repose. ω ¹³ m
For now that the senate has been abolished and the
eourts have been closed, what is there, in keeping with
my sels-respect, that Ι can do either in the senate-
chamber or in the forum? So, although Ι once
lived amid throngs of people and in the greatest
publicity, Ι am now shunning the sight of the mis-
creants with whom the world abounds and with-
drawing from the public eye as far as I may, and Ι
am often alone. But I have learned from philoso-
phers that among evils one ought not only to choos'e
the least, but also to extract even from these any
element of good that they may contain. For that
reason, I am turning my leisure to account—though
it is not such repose as the man should be entitled
to who once brought the state repose from civil
strife-—and I am not letting this solitude, which
necessity and not my will imposes on me, find me idle.

And yet, in my judgment, Africanus earned the
higher praise. For no literary monuments of his
genius have been published, we have no work pro-
duced in his leisure hours, no product of his solitude.
From this fact we may safely infer that, because ot
the activity of his mind and the study of those prob-
lems to which he used to direct his thought, he
was never unoccupied, never lonely. But I have
not strength of mind enough by means of silent
meditation to forget my solitude3 and so Ι have
turned all my attention and endeavour to this kind
of literary work. Ι have, accordingly, written more
in this short time since the downfall of the republic
than Ι did in the course of many years, while the
republic stood.
