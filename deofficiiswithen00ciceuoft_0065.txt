BOOK I. xii

eestors what we now call “stranger” (peregrznus).
This is proved by the usage in the Twelve Tables:
“Or a day fixed for trial with a stranger'' (hostis).
And again: “Right of ownership is inalienable for
ever in dealings with a stranger” (hostis). What
can exceed such charity, when he with whom one is
at war is called by so gentle a name? And yet
long lapse of time has given that word a harsher
meaning: for it has lost its signification of “stranger '’
and has taken on the technical connotation of an
enemy under arms.”

But when a war is fought out for supremacy and Justicein war.
when glory is the object of war, it must still not fail
to start from the same motives which Ι said a moment
ago were the only righteous grounds for going to
war. But those wars which have glory for their end
must be carried on with less bitterness. For we
contend, for example, with a fellow-citizen in one
way, if he is a personal enemy, in another, if he is a
rival: with the riva] it is a struggle for office and
position, with the enemy for life and honour. So
with the Celtiberians and the Cimbrians we fought
as with deadly enemies, not to determine which
should be supreme, but which should survive3 but
with the Latins, Sabines, Samnites, Carthaginians'‚
and Pyrrhus we fought for supremacy. The Cartha-
ginians violated treaties; Hannibal was crue13 the
others were more merciful. From Pyrrhus we have

this famous speech on the exchange of prisoners:
“ Gold will I none, nor price shall ye give 3 for I ask none;
Come, let us not be chaff’rers of war, but warriors
embattled.
Nay; let us venture our lives, and the sword, not
gold, weigh the outcome.
