Nor is it out of place in making a choice between (ξ) by the criti·
duties involving a doubt, to consult men of learning ἳζῖζὲς ⁰¹²¹¹⁸
or practical wisdom and to ascertain what their views
are on any particular question of duty. For the
majority usually drift as the current of their own
natural inclinations carries them ; and in deriving
counsel from one of these, we have to sce not only
what our adviser says, but also what he thinks, and
what his reasons are for thinking as he does. For,
as painters and sculptors and even poets, too, wish
to have their works reviewed by the public, in order
that, if any point is generally criticized, it may be
improved ; and as they try to discover both by them-
selves and with the help of others what is wrong in
their work3 so through consulting the judgment of
others we find that there are many things to be done
and left undone, to be altered and improved.

But no rules need to be given about what is done Theiaws οι
in accordance with the established customs and con- ξξῗεξῐζξῇζζξ
ventions of a community3 for these are in themselves
rules; and no one ought to make the mistake of
supposing that, because Socrates or Aristippus did
or said something contrary to the manners and estab-
lished customs of their city, he has a right to do the
same3 it was only by reason of their great and super-
human virtues that those famous men acquired this
special privilege. But the Cynics' whole system of
sensibility, and without moral sensibility nothing
can be upright, nothing morally good.

It is, furthermore, our duty to honour and rever· special rulesa
enee those whose lives are conspicuous for conduct
in keeping with their high moral standards, and who,

“s true patriots, have rendered or are now renderinv
