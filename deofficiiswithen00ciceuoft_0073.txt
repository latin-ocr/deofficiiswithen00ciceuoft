the hands of strangers should, for that reason, not
be regarded as generosity3 for nothing is genevous,
if it is not at the same time just.

Μ· The second point for the exercise of caution was (2) within our
that our beneficence should not exceed our means; mmmmmm
for those who wish to be more open-handed than
their circumstances permit are guilty of two faults:
first, they do wrong to their next of kin 3 for they

property, in order to supply the means for making
large gifts. We may also observe that a great many
people do many things that seem to be inspired
more by a spirit of ostentation than by heart-felt
kindness; for such people are not really generous
but are rather influenced by a sort of ambition to
make a show of being open-handed. Such a pose
is nearer akin to hypocrisy than to generosity or
moral goodness.

should take into consideration his moral character, .
his attitude toward us, the intimacy of his relations
to us, and our common social ties, as well as the
services he has hitherto rendered in our interest.

weight.
