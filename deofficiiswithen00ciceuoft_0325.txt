BOOK III. vii

dear Cicero, I ask you to assume with me, if you ean, Mo ora aglki ht
that nothing ls worth the seeking for its own sakeo ὴῖὴέιςζῗῖῗέᾱ
except what 1s morally right. But if Cratippusa does
not permit this assumption, you will still grant this
at least—that what is morally right is the object
most worth the seeking for its own sake. Either
alternative is sufficient for my purposes3 first the one
and then the other seems to me the more probable;
and besides these, there is no other alternative that
seems probable at all. b
34 ln the first place, Ι must undertake the defence Vi uideation ot
of Panaetius on this point3 for he has said not that paffif, ’ἐξ ube
the truly expedient could under certain circum· exgedgnhthat
stances clash with the morally right (for he could nighxaeora y
not have said that conscientiously ⁰,) but only that
what seemed expedient could do so. For he often
bears witness to the fact that nothing is really ex-
pedient that is not at the same time morally right,
and nothing morally right that is not at the same
time expedient; and he says that no greater curse
has ever assailed human life than the doctrine of
those who have separated these two conceptions. And
so he introduced an apparent, not a real, conflict
between them, not to the end that we should under
certain circumstances give the expedient preference
over the moral, but that, in ease they ever should get
in each other’s way, we might decide between them
without uncertainty. This part, therefore, which
was passed over by Panaetius, I will carry to com-
pletion without any auxiliaries, but fighting my own
battle, as the saying is. For of all that has been
worked out on this line since the time of Panaetius,
nothing that has come into my hands is at all satis-

factory to me.
