can be expedient? Furthermore, can hatred and
shame be expedient for any government? For
government ought to be founded upon fair fame

and the loyalty of allies?

On this point Ι often disagreed even with my (3)b<¹23t0
friend Cato; it seemed to me that he was too rigor· u ¹⁰³⁰
ous in his watchful care over the claims of the
treasury and the revenues3 he refused everything
that the farmers of the revenue asked for and much
that the allies desired3 whereas, as I insisted, it was
our duty to be generous to the allies and to treat
the publicans as we were accustomed individually to
treat our tenants—and all the more, because harmony
between the orders was essentia] to the welfare of
the republic.a Curio, v too, was wrong, when he (4) Curiofmd
pleaded that the demands of the people beyond the the ⁰⁰¹⁰¹¹¹e⁵'
Po were just, but never failed to add “Let expedi-
ency prevail.'’ He ought rather to have proved
that the claims were not just, because they were
not expedient for the republic, than to have admitted
that they were just, when, as he maintained, they

were not expedient.

xxm. The sixth book of Hecaton‘s “Moral Hecaton flebam
Duties'' is full of questions like the following: “Is ξξῗὲὥξῗέζῃ of
it consistent with a good man's duty to let his slaves
go hungry when provisions are at famine prices?'’

Hecaton gives the arguments on both sides of the
question; but still in the end it is by the standard of
expediency, as he conceives it, rather than by one of
human feeling, that he decides the question of duty.

Then he raises this question: supposing a man
had to throw part of his cargo overboard in a storm,
should he prefer to sacrifice a high-priced horse or a

cheap and worthless slave? In this case reg6ard for
