BOOK 111. xviii

Lucius Minucius Basilus. The more easily to pro-
cure validity for it, they made joint-heirs with them-
selves two of the most influential men of the day,
Marcus Crassus and Quintus Hortensius. Although
these men suspected that the will was a forgery,
still, as they were conscious of no personal guilt in
