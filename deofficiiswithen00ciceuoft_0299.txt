5 Π. But, my dear Cicero, while the whole field of Youngvcicero
philosophy is fertile and productive and no portion dllissggffllladhtss
of it barren and waste, still no part is richer or more ⁵¹⁰d¹⁸³·
fruitful than that which deals with moral duties3 for
from these are derived the rules for leading a con-

responsibility on account of Athens and Cratippus:
for since you have gone to them for the purchase,
as it were, of a store of liberal culture, it would be
a great discredit to you to return empty-handed,
thereby disgracing the high reputation of the city
and of your master. Therefore, put forth the best
mental effort of which you are capable3 work as
hard as you can (if learning is work rather than
pleasure) ; do your very best to succeed ; and do not,
when Ι have put all the necessary means at your
disposal, allow it to be said that you have failed to
do your part.

But enough of this. For I have written again
and again for your encouragement. Let us now
