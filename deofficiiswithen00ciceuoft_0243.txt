if his speech have also dignity combined with mode-
ration, he will be admired beyond all measure,
especially if these qualities are found in a young man.

But while there are occasions of many kinds that
call for eloquenoe, and while many young men in
our republic have obtained distinction by their
speeches in the courts, in the popular assemblies,
and in the senate, yet it is the speeches before our
courts that excite the highest admiration.

The classification of forensic speeches also is a prosecution

while the side of the defence is more honourable,
still that of the prosecution also has very often
established· a reputation. I spoke of Crassus a mo-

same success. A prosecution brought the eloquence
of Publius Sulpicius into favourable notice, when he
brought an action against Gaius Norbanus, a sedi-

done often—never, in fact, except in the interest ot
the state (as in the cases of those above mentioned)

did) or for the protection of our provincials (as Ι did
in the defence of the Sicilians, or Julius in the prose-
cution of Albucius in behalf of the Sardinians). The
activity of Lucius Fufius in the impeachment of
Manius Aquilius is likewise famous. This sort of
work, then, may be done once in a lifetime, or at all
events not often. But if it shall be required of any-
one to conduct more frequent prosecutions‚ let> him
do it as a service to his country3 for it is no disgrace
to be osten employed in the prosecution of her
