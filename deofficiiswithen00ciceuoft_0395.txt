XXV. No more binding are those promises which
are inexpedient for the persons themselves to whom
they have been given. To go back to the realm of
story, the sungod promised his son Phaethon to do
for him whatever he should wish. His wish was to
be allowed to ride in his father’s chariot. It was
granted. And before he came back to the ground
he was consumed by a stroke of lightning. How
much better had it been, if in his case the father’s
promise had not been kept. And what of that
promise, the fulfilment of which Theseus required
from Neptune? When Neptune offered him three
wishes, he wished for the death of his son Hippoly-
tus, because the father was suspicions of the son’s
relations with his step-mother. And when this wish
was granted, Theseus was overwhelmed with grief.
And once more; when Agamemnon had vowed to
Diana the most beautiful creature born that year
within his realm, he was brought to sacrifice Iphi-
genia3 for in that year nothing was born more
beautiful than she. He ought to have broken his
vow rather than commit so horrible a crime.

that a person leaves his sword with you when he is
in his right mind, and demands it back in a fit of
insanity; it would be criminal to restore it to him;
it would be your duty not to do so. Again, suppose
that a man who has entrusted money to you proposes
to make war upon your common country, should you
restore the trust? Ι believe you should not3 for
