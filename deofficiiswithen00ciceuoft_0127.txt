tween justice and considerateness in one's relations
'o one’s fellow-men. It is the function of justice
not to do wrong to one's fellow-men3 of consider-
ateness, not to wound their feelings; and in this the
essence of propriety is best seen.

With the foregoing exposition, Ι think it is clear
what the nature is of what we term propriety.

Further, as to the duty which has its source in Dupies pre-
propriety, the first road on which it conducts us ἷῖξζιξξᾱ by pro-
leads to harmony with Nature and the faithful ob-
servance of her laws. If we follow Nature as our (1)10110w
guide, we shall never go astray, but we shall be Nature,
pursuing that which is in its nature clear-sighted
and penetrating (Wisdom), that which is adapted to
promote and strengthen society (Justiee), and that
which is strong and courageous (Fortitude). But
the very essence of propriety is found in the division
of virtue which is now under discussion (Temper-
ance). For it is only when they agree with Nature’s
laws that we should give our approval to the move-
ments not only of the body, but still more of the
spirit.

Now we find that tne essential activity of the (2)sur>ject
spirit is twofold: one force is appetite (that is, ὁρμή, {3525}ssssoe ω
in Greek), which impels a man this way and that3
the other is reason, which teaches and explains
what should be done and what should be left undone.

The result is that reason commands, appetite obeys.

XXIX. Again, every action ought to be free from
undue haste or carelessness; neither ought we to
do anything for which we cannot assign a reasonable
motive3 for in these words we have practically a
definition of duty.

The appetites, moreover‚ must be made to obey
