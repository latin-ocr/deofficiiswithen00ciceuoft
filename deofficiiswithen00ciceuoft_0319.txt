whoever he may be, just because he is a fellow—man,
then it follows, in accordance with that same nature,
that there are interests that all men have in com-
mon. And if this is true, we are all subject to one
and the same law of nature; and if this also is true,
we are certainly forbidden by nature's law to wrong

to endure all possible loss, whether to his property
or to his person . . . or even to his very soul——so far
as these losses are not concerned with justice²²; for

this virtue is the sovereign mistress and queen of
all the virtues.
