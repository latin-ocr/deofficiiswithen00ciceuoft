human society more closely together, man to man.
The foundation of j ustice, moreover, is good faith— Good {aith-
that is, truth and fidelity to promises and agree-
ments. And therefore we may follow the Stoics,
who diligently investigate the etymology of words3
and we may accept their statement 'chat‘ good faith”

the other or 'gart of those who, when they can, do

not shield from wrong those upon whom it is being
inflicted. For he who, under the influence of anger
or some other passion, wrongfully assaults another
seems, as it were, to be laying violent hands upon a
comrade3 b ,ἱ ἰε who does not prevent or oppose
wrong, if he can, is just as guilty of wrong as if he
deserted his parents or his friends or his country.
Then, too, those very wrongs which people try to in-
flict on purpose to injure are often the result of sear:
that is, he who premeditates injuring another is
afraid that, if he does not do so, he may himself be
made to suffer some hurt. But for the most part,
pcople are led to wrong-doing in order to secure
some personal end ; in this vice, avarice is generally
the controlling motive.

VIII. Again, men seek riches partly to supply
the needs of life, partly to secure the enjoyment of
pleasure. With those who cherish higher ambitions, The daungers of
the desire for wealth is enteltained with a view to ³⁰¹me
power and influenee and the means of bestowing
favours3 Marcus Crassus, for example, not long since
