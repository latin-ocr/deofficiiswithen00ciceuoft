BOOK 111. iii-iv

many people attain to the knowledge οἳ them through
natural goodness of heart and through advancement
in learning. But that duty which those same Stoics call
“right” is perfect and absolute and“satisf1es all the
numbers‚” aas that same school says, and is attainable
by none except the wise man. On the other hand,

*when some act1s performed in which we see‘ ‘mean”

which catches the fancy of the uneducated, because
these have not the ability to discover the points of

perfect models of courage or the latter as a perfect
model of justice, as if we had in one of them the
ideal‘ ‘wise man. ’⁹ For no one of them was wise in
