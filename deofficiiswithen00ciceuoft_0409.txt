that is, shall one “ choose moral wrong rather than
missortune,” or is there any evil greater than moral
wrong? For if physical deformity excites a certain
amount of aversion, how offensive ought the defor-
mity and hideousness of a demoralized soul to seem!

more rigour make bold to say that moral wrong is
the only evil, while thoseb who treat them with
inglre laxity do not hesitate to call it the supreme

“None have Ι given, none give Ι ever to the
faithless.''

It was proper for the poet to say that, because, when

[j he was working out his Atreus, he had to make the

words fit the character. But if they mean to adopt
it as a principle, that a pledge given to the faithless
is no pledge, let them look to it that it be not a mere
loophole for perjury that they seek.

and fidelity to an oath must often be observed in
dealings with an enemy: for an oath sworn with the
clear understanding in one’s own mind that it should
be performed must be kept3 but if there is no such
understanding, it does not count as perjury if one
does not perform the vow. For example, suppose
that one does not deliver the amount agreed upon
with pirates as the price of one's life, that would be
accounted no deception—not even if one should fail
to deliver- the ransom after having sworn to do so;
for a pirate is not included in the number of lawful
enemies, but is the common foe of all the world;
and with him there ought not to be any pledged
