BOOK l. xxiv-xxv

How much better was the conduct of Quintus
⁴' Maximus! Of him Ennius says:

“One man—and he alone—restored our state by
delaying.

Not in the least did fame with him take prece-
dence of safety3

Therefore now does his glory shine bright‚ and it
grows ever brighter.”

This sort of offencea must be avoided no less in
political life. For there are men who for fear of
giving offence do not darc to express their honest

opinion, no matter how excellent. s
85 XXV. Those who propose to take charge of the Effllirl'istration

affairs of government should not fail to remember two must be free

of Plato’s rules: first, to keep the good of the people “⁰¹²¹

so clearly in view that regardless of their own in-

terests they will make their every action conform to

that; second, to care for the welfare of the whole

body politic and not in serving the interests of some (upanisanship

one party to betray the rest. For the administra-

tion of the government, like the office of a trustee,

must be conducted for the benefit of those entrusted

to one’s care, not of those to whom it is entrusted.

Now, those who care for the interests of a part of

the citizens and neglect another part, introduce

into the civil service a dangerous element-—dissen-

sion and party strife. The result is that some

are found to be loyal supporters of the democratic,

others of the aristocratic party, and few of the nation

as a whole.
86 As aresult of this party spirit bitter strife arose

at Athens,b and in our own country not only dis-

sensionsc but also disastrous civil warsd broke ont.
