and learning. Accordingly, if the talk begins to
drift off to other channels, pains should be taken to
bring it back again to the matter in hand—but with
due consideration to the company present3 for we
are not all interested in the same things at all times
or in the same degree. We ‚must observe, too, how
far the conversation is agreeable and, as it had a
reason for its beginning, so there should be a point
at which to close it tactfully.

,36 XXXVIII. But as we have a most excellent rule Propriety
for every phase of life, to avoid exhibitions of passion, Οἱ speech
that is, mental excitement that is excessive and un-
controlled by reason3 so our conversation ought to
be free from such emotions :let there be no exhibition
of anger or inordinate desire, of indolence or indiffe-
rence, or anything of the kind. We must also take
the greatest care to show courtesy and consideration
toward those with whom we converse.

It may sometimes happen that there is need of (nin reproots,
administering reproof. On such occasions we should,
perhaps, use a more emphatic tone of voice and
more forcible and severe terms and even assume an
appearance of being angry. But we shall have re-
course to this sort of reproof, as we do to cautery
and amputation, rarely and reluctantly—never at all,
unless it is unavoidable and no other remedy can be Α
discovered. We may seem angry, but anger should
be far from us3 for in anger nothing right or judi-

[37 cious can be done. In most cases, we may apply a
mild reproof, so combined, however, with earnest-
ness, that while severity is shown, offensive language
is avoided. Nay more, we must show clearly that
even that very harshness which goes with our re-
proof is designed for the good of the person reproved.
