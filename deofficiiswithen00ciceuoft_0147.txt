BOOK I. xxxiii

which still greater care must be given, in order
that we may be true to ourselves throughout all our
lives and not salter in the discharge of any duty.

But since the most powerful influence in the
choice of a career is exerted by Nature, and the next
most powerful by Fortune, we must, of course, take
account of them both in deciding upon our calling
in life3 but of the two, Nature claims the more atten-

steadfast, that for Fortune to come into conflict with
Nature seems like a combat between a morta] and a
goddess. If, therefore, anyone has conformed his
whole plan of life to the kind of nature that is his
(that is, his better nature), let him go on with it
consistently—for that is the essence of Propriety—
unless, perchance, he should discover that he has
made a mistake in choosing his life work. If this change of
should happen (and it can easily happen), he must vocation-
change his vocation and mode of life. If circumstances
favour such change, it will be effected with greater
¹ ease and convenience. If not, it must be made grad-
ually, step by step, just as, when friendships become
no longer pleasing or desirable, it is more proper
(so wise men think) to undo the bond little by little
than to sever it at a stroke. And when we have
once changed our calling in life, we must take all
possible care to make it clear that we have done so
with good reason.

But whereas I said a moment ago that we have to
follow in the steps of our fathers, let me make the
following exceptions: first, we need not imitate
their faults3 second, we need not imitate certain
other things, if our nature does not permit such
imitation3 for example, the son of the elder Africa-
nus (that Scipio who adopted the younger Africanus,
