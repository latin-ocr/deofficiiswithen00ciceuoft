masters of the Latin tongue. Their pronunciation
was charming3 their words were neither mouthed
nor mumbled: they avoided both indistinctness and
affectation3 their voices were free from strain, yet
neither faint nor shrill. More copious was the speech
of Lucius Crassus and not less brilliant, but the re·
putation of the two Catuli for eloquence was fully
equa] to his. But in wit and humour Caesar, the
elder Catulus’s half-brother, surpassed them all:
even at the bar he would with his conversational
style defeat other advocates with their elaborate
orations.

If, therefore, we are aiming to secure propriety in
every circumstance of life, we must master all these
points.

Conversation, then, in which the Socratics are the
best models, should have these qualities. It should
be easy and not in the least dogmatic; it should have
the spice of wit. And the one who engages in con-
versation should not debar others from participating
in it, as if he were entering upon a private monopoly;
but, as in other things, so in a general conver-
sation he should think it not unfair for each to have
his turn. He should observe, first and foremost,
what the subject of conversation is. If it is grave,
he should treat it with seriousness3 if humorous,

f with wit. And above all, he should be on the watch

that his conversation shall not betray some defect in
his character. This is most likely to occur, when
people in jest or in ear-nest take delight in making
malicious and slanderous statements about the ab-
sent, on purpose to injure their reputations.

ΤΙιε subjects of conversation are usually affairs of
the home or politics or the practice of the professions
