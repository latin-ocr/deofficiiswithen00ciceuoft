that would be a confession that they are criminally
minded; should they say that they would not do
so, they would be granting that all things in and of
themselves immoral should be avoided.

But let us now return to our theme.

X. Many cases oftentimes arise to perplex our Conflicts
minds with a specious appearance of expediency: the ffitgvgggjem
question raised in these cases is not whether moral Expediency and
rectitude is to be sacrificed to some considerable Jusuce,
advantage (for that would of course be wrong), but
whether the apparent advantage can be secured
without moral wrong. When Brutus deposed his
colleague Collatinus from the consular office, his
treatment of him might have been thought unjust3
for Collatinus had been his associate, and had helped
him with word and deed in driving out the royal
family. But when the leading men of the state had
determined that all the kindred of Superbus and the
very name of the T arquins and every reminder of the
monarchy should be obliterated, then the course that
was expedient—namely, to serve the country‘s in-
terests—was so pre-eminently right, that it was even
Collatinus's own duty to acquiesce in its justice. And
so expediency gained the day because of its moral
rightness3 for without moral rectitude there could
have been no possible expediency.

Not so in the case of the kinga who founded the
city: it was the specious appearance of expediency

that actuated him3 and when he decided that it

· was more expedient for him to reign alone than to

share the throne with another, he slew his brother.b

He threw to the winds his brotherly affection and his

human feehngs, to secure what seemed to him—but

was not—expedient3 and yet in defence of his deed
