BOOK ΙΙΙ. xxix

This argument, at all events, has no more weight (1) An oathis a
against Regulus’s conduct than it has against the ῗῖιζξξοζῃξζέὡ
keeping of any other oath. But in taking an oath G00d Faitm
it is our duty to consider not what one may have to
fear in case of violation but wherein its obligation
lies: an oath is an assurance backed by religious
sanctity3 and a solemn promise given, as before God
as one's witness, is to be sacredly kept. For the

uestion no longer concerns the wrath of the gods ⁷
for there is no such thing) but the obligations of

justice and good saith. For, as Ennius says so
admirably:

“Gracious Good F aith, on wings upborne3
thou oath in J upiter’s great name ! ”

Whoever, therefore, violates his oath violates Good
Faith3 and, as we find it stated in Cato’s speech, our
forefathers chose that she should dwell upon the
Capitol “neighbour to Jupiter Supreme and Best.’¹

‘ But,’' objection was further made, “ even if
Jupiter had been angry, he could not have inflicted
greater injury upon Regulus than Regulus brought
upon himself.'¹

Quite true, if there is no evil except pain. But whatisevil?
philosophersa of the highest authority assure us that
pain is not only not the supreme evil but no evil at
all. And pray do not disparage Regulus, as no un-
important witness—nay, I am rather inclined to
think he was the very best witness—to the truth of
their doctrine. For what more competent witness
do we ask for than one of the foremost citizens of
Rome, who voluntarily faced torture for the sake of
being true to his moral duty?

Again, they say “Of evils ehoose the least'’-
