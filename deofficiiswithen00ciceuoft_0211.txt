justice and humanity will permit.

can gain the ability to win and hold the affections of
our fellow-men; but I must say a few words by way

then, does send those other less usual calamities,
arising, first, from inanima-te nature—hurricanes,
storms, shipwrecks, catastrophes, conflagrati0ns3
second, from wild beasts—kicks, bites, and attacks.

masses, too, and the banishment that as a conse-
quence frequently comes to men of eminent ser-
vices, their degradation and voluntary exile; think,
on the other hand, of the successes, the civil and
military honours, and the victories3—though all
these contain an element of chance, still they
cannot be brought about, whether for good or for

in our service. And if the discussion of this point
is unduly prolonged, let the length be compared
