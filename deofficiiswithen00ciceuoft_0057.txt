would usually demand. For we may well be guided
by those fundamental principles of justice which 1
laid down at the outset: first, that no harm be done
to anyone; second, that the common interests be
conserved. When these are modified under changed
circumstances, moral duty also undergoes a change,
and it does not always remain the same. For a given
promise or agreement may turn out in such a way
that its performance will prove detrimental either to
the one to whom the promise has been made or to
the one who has made it. If, for example, Neptune,
in the drama, had not carried out his promise to
Theseus, Theseus would not have lost his son
Hippolytus; for, as the story runs, of the three
wishesa that Neptune had promised to grant him the
third was this: in a fit of anger he prayed for the
death of Hippolytus, and the granting of this prayer
plunged him into unspeakable grief. Promises are,
therefore, not to be kept, if the keeping of them is
to prove harmful to those to whom you have made
them3 and, if the fulfilment of a promise should do
more harm to you than good to him to whom you
have made it, it is no violation of moral duty to give
the greater good precedence over the lesser good.
For example, if you have made an appointment with
anyone to appear as his advocate in court, and if in
the meantime your son should fall dangerously ill, it
would be no breach of your moral duty to fail in what
you agreed to do ; nay, rather, he to whom your
promise was given would have a false conception of
duty, if he should complain that he had been deserted
in his time of need. Further than this, who fails to
see that those promises are not binding which are
extorted by intimidation or which we make when
