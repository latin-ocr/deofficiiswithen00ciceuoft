now (and a great deal by and by), I wish, if possible, subject.
-to begin with a matter most suited at once to your
years and to my position. Although philosophy
offers many problems, both important and useful,
that have been fully and carefully discussed by
philosophers, those teachings which have been
handed down on the subject of moral duties seem
to have the widest practical application. For no
phase of life, whether public or private, whether in
business or in the home, whether one is working on
what concerns oneself alone or dealing with
another, can be without its moral duty3 on the
discharge of such duties depends all that is morally
right, and on their neglect all that is morally wrong
in life.

5 Moreover, the subject of this inquiry is the com- The philosophi«
mon property of all philosophers3 for who would {effi-{ils ¹{lenadchim
presume to call himself a philosopher, if he did not
inculcate any lessons of duty? But there are some
schools that distort all notions of duty by the theories
they propose touching the supreme good and the
supreme evil. For he who posits the supreme good
as having no connection with virtue and measures it
not by a moral standard but by his own interests—
if he should be consistent and not rather at times
over-ruled by his better nature, he could value
neither friendship nor justice nor generosity3 and
brave he surely cannot possibly be that counts pain
the supreme evil, nor temperate he that holds
pleasure to be the supreme good.
