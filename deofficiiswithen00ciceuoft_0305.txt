not morally right, it is not expedient.

12 But if Panaetius were the sort of man to say that
virtue is worth cultivating only because it is produc-
tive of advantage, as do certain philosophers who
measure the desirableness of things by the standard
of pleasure or of absence of pain, he might argue that
expediency sometimes clashes with moral rectitude.
But since he is a man who judges that the morally
right is the only good, and that those things which
come in conflict with it have only the appearance of
expediency and cannot make life any better by their
presence nor any worse by their absence, it follows
that he ought not to have raised a question involv-

13 what is morally right. Furthermore, when the
Stoics speak of the supreme good as “-living conform-
ably to natu1·e‚” they mean, as I take it, something
like this: that we are always to be in accord with
virtue, and from all other things that may be in
harmony with nature to choose only such as are not
incompatible with virtue. This being so, some
people are of the opinion that it was not right to
introduce this counterbalancing of right and expedi-
ency and that no practical instruction should have
been given on this question at all.

And yet moral goodness, in the true and proper
sense of the term, is the exclusive possession ofrthe
wise and can never be separated from virtue3 but
those who have not perfect wisdom cannot possibly
have perfect moral goodness, but only a semblance

these books the Stoics call “mean duties ’' a; they are a The “absolute
common possession and have wide application ; and ³¹¹⁶ ‘¹²0 “mean
