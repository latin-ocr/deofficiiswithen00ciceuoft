BOOK Ι. xxxv-xxxvi

But we should give no heed to the Cynics (or to
some Stoics who are practically Cynics) who censure
and ridicule us for holding that the mere mention of
some actions that are not immoral is shameful, while
other things that are immoral we call by their real
names. Robbery, fraud„and adultery, for example,
are immoral in deed, but it is not indecent to name
them. To beget children in wedlock is in deed
morally right; to speak of it is indecent. And they
assail modesty with a great many other arguments
to the same purport. But as for us, let us follow
nature and shun everything that is offensive to our
eyes or our ears. So, in standing or walking, in
sitting or reclining, in our expression, our eyes, or
the movements of our hands, let us preserve what
we have called “propriety.’'

In these matters we must avoid especially the two
extremes: our conduct and speech should not be
effeminate and over-nice, 011 the one hand, nor coarse
and boorish, on the other. And we surely must not
admit that while this rule applies to actors and ora-
tors, it is not binding upon us. As for stage-people,
their custom, because of its traditional discipline,
carries modesty to such a point that an actor would
never step out upon the stage without a breech-cloth
on, for fear he might make 311 improper exhibition,
if by some accident certain parts of his person should
happen to become exposed. And in our own custom,
grown sons do not bathe with their fathers, nor
sons-in-law with their fathers-in-law. We must,
therefore, keep to the path of this sort of modesty,
especially when Nature is our teacher and guide.

XXXVI. Again, there are two orders of beauty:

Propriety:
(1) in outward

in the one, loveliness predominates; in the other, appearance;
