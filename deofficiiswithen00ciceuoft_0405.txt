what greater injury could He have inflicted upon
Regulus than Regulus brought upon himself? Re-
ligious scruple, therefore, had no such preponderance
as to outweigh so great expediencyff'
“Or was he afraid that his act would be morally (2) οι· two
wrong? As to that, first of all, the proverb says ῗθζζῑεε ⁰¹¹⁰⁰⁵⁶th⁹
‘Of evils choose the least? Did that moral wrong,
then, really involve as great an evil as did that awful

torture? And secondly, there are the lines of Accius:

Thyestes. ‘Hast thou broke thy saith. ³⁹

Atreus. N one have I giv’ n; none give I ever to
the faithless.’

Although this sentiment is put into the mouth of a

wicked king, still it is illuminating in its correct-

ne'Slffheir third argument is this· just as we maintain (3) oaths
that some things seem expedient but are not, segg„ '‘⁰“ Οζξξ duam

are not. “For example‚” they contend, 111 this

returned t'o torture for the sake of being true to his
oath. But it proves not to be morally right, because
what an enemy extorted by force ought not to have
been binding.''

As their concluding argument, they add. what· (4)exceionpt1m1
ever is highly expedient may prove to be morallye ma ’‘Pkgsoe ἵζω
right, even if it did not seem so in advance.

These are in substance the arguments raised
against the conduct of Regulus. Let us consider
them each in turn.

XXIX. “ He need not have been afraid that Rebuttal.
Jupiter in anger would inflict injury upon him; he
is not wont to be angry or hurtful.”
