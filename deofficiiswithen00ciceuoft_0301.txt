that we have, and I have followed him' in the main
—but with slight modifications. He classifies under ·
three general heads the ethical problems which
people are accustomed to consider and weigh z first,
the question whether the matter in hand is morally
right or morally wrong ; second, whether it is ex-
pedient or inexpedient; third, how a decision ought
to be reached, in case that which has the appearance
of being morally right clashes with that which seems
to be expedient. He has treated the first two heads
at length in three books3 but while he has stated
that he meant to discuss the third head in its proper
turn, he has never fulfilled his promise. And Ι
wonder the more at this, because Posidonius, a pupil
of his, records that Panaetius was still alive thirty
years after he published those three books. And I
am surprised that Posidonius has but briefly touched
upon this subject in certain memoirs of his, and
especially, as he states that there is no other topic in
the whole range of philosophy so essentially impor-
tant as this.

Now, I cannot possibly accept the view of those why Panaetius
who say that that point was not overlooked but pur- ἳῗξὲᾒῗοῗὶῗ 05

be such a thing as a confliet between expediency and
moral rectitude. But with regard to this assertion,
the one point may admit of doubt—whether that
question which is third in Panaetius’s classification

ought to have been included or omitted altogether3
