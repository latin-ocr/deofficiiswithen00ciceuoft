writings you will be sure to render your mastery of
the Latin language more complete. But I would by
no means have you think that this is said boastfully.
For there are many to whom 1 yield precedence in
knowledge of philosophy; but if I lay claim to the
orator’s peculiar ability to speak with propriety,
clearness, elegance, Ι think my claim is in a measure
justified, ’for I have spent my life m that profession.

And therefore, my dear Cicero, Ι cordially re· Philoso 0th

commend you to read carefully not only my orations buta
also thesea books of mine on philosophy, which are
now about as extensive. For while the orations ex-
hibit a more vigorous style, yet the unimpassioned,
restrained style of my philosophie-al productioris is
also worth cultivating. Moreover, for the same man
to succeed in both departments, both in the forensic
style and in that of calm philosophie discussion has
not, Ι observe, been the good fortune of any one of the
Greeks so far, unless, perhaps, Demetrius of Phalerum
can be reckoned in that number—a elever reasoner,
indeed, and, though rather a spiritless orator, he is
yet charming, so that you can recognize in him the
disciple of Theophrastus. But let others judge how
much Ι have accomplished in each pursuit3 I have
at least attempted both.

I believe, of course, that if Plato had been willing
to devote himself to forensic oratory, he could have
spoken with the greatest eloquence and power; and
that if Demosthenes had continued the studies he
pursued with Plato and had wished to expound his
views, he could have done so with elegance and
brilliancy. I feel the same way about Aristotle and
Isocrates, each of whom, engrossed in his own pro-
fession, undervalued that of the other.
