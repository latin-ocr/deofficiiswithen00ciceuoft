was included in Panaetius's plan but left unwritten.
For if a writer has finished two divisions of a three-

him to do. Besides, he promises at the close of the
third book that he will discuss this division also in its
proper turn. We have also in Posidonius a com-

a conceptual distinction between things naturally
inseparable. With this doctrine the Stoics are in
agreement in so far as they maintain that if anything
