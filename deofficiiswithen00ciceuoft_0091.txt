BOOK Ι. xix

But the mischief is that from this exaltation and
greatness of spirit spring all too readily sels-will and
excessive lust for power. For just as Plato tells us that
the whole national character of the Spartans was on
fire with passion for victory, so, in the same way, the
more notable a man is for his greatness of spirit, the
more ambitious he is to be the foremost citizen, or, I
should say rather, to be sole ruler. But when one
begins to aspire to pre-eminence, it is difficult to
preserve that spirit of fairness which is absolutely
essential to justice. The result is that such men do
not allow themselves to be constrained either by
argument or by any public and lawful authority; but
they only too often prove to be bribers and agitators
in public life, seeking to obtain supreme power and
to be superiors through force rather than equals
through justice. But the greater the difficulty, the
greater the glory3 for no occasion arises that can
excuse a man for being guilty of injustice.

So then, not those who do injury but those who AErggifirtfatness

prevent it are to be considered brave and courageous.
Moreover, true and philosophie greatness of spirit
regards the moral goodness to which nature most
aspires as consisting in deeds, not in fame, and pre-
fers to be first in reality rather than in name. And
we must approve this view; for he who depends upon
the caprice of the ignorant rabble cannot be num-
bered among the great. Then, too, the higher a
man-’s ambition, the more easily he is tempted to
acts of injustice by his desire for fame. We are now,
to be sure, on very slippery ground3 for scarcely can
the man be found who has passed through trials and
encountered dangers and does not then wish for
glory as a reward for his achievements.
