treat at length in the following books.

8 And yet there is still another classification of

duties: we distinguish between “mean”² duty, so-
called, and “absolute” duty. Absolute duty we
may, I presume, call “ right,’' for the Greeks call it
κατόρθωμα, while the ordinary duty they call καθῆκον.
And the meaning of those terms they fix thus: what-
ever is right they define as absolute duty, but
“mean’' duty, they say, is duty for the performance
of which an adequate reason may be rendered⁴

is, therefore, as Panaetius thinks, a threefold one: ἷξζζῗξζῗὲοῃ ⁰¹
first, people que tion whether the contemplated act
is morally right or morally wrong3 and in such
deliberation their minds are often led to widely
divergent conclusions. And then they examine and
consider the question whether the action contem-
plated is or is not conducive to comfort and happiness

. in life, to the command of means and wealth, to
influence, and to power, by which they may be able
to help themselves and their friends3 this whole
matter turns upon a question of expediency. The
third type of question arises when that which seems
to be expedient seems to conflict with that which is

’ morally right; for when expediency seems to be pull-
ing one way, while moral right seems to be calling
back in the opposite direction, the result is that the
mind is distracted in its inquiry and brings to it the
irresolution that is born of deliberation.

classification, two points have been overlooked in fivefold.

honestus, on the other hand, is always ¹ honourable '; and
bonores are always ‘ offices of honour.’
