our means, wealth, and resources by despoiling
others

But this principle is established not by nature’ s (mot natio ons,

laws alone (that is, by the· common rules of equity),
but also by the statutes of particular communitieS, in
accordancemith which in individual states the public
interests are maintained. In all these it is with one
accord ordained that no man shall be allowed for the
sake of his own advantage to injure his neighbour.
For it is to this that the laws have regard; this is
their intent, that the bonds of union between citi-
zens should not be impaired3 and any attempt to

destroy these bonds is repressed by the penalty of
death, exile, imprisonment, or fine.

Again, this principle follows much more effectually {3233} gods an

directly from the Reason which is in Nature, which
is the law of gods and men. If anyone will hearken
to that voice (and all will hearken to it who wish to
live in accord with nature’s laws), he will never be
guilty of coveting anything that is his neighbour's
or of appropriating to himself what he has taken
from his neighbour. Then‚ too, loftiness and great-
ness of spirit, and courtesy, justice, and generosity
are much more in harmony with nature than are
selfish pleasure, riches, and life itself3 but· it requires
a great and lofty spirit to despise these latter and
count them as naught, when one weighs them over

against the common weal. [But for anyone to rob Se it-seekm ¹¹8
his neighbour for his own profit is more contrary to seli- sacr xifice

nature than death, pain, and the like]

In like manner it is more in accord with nature
to emulate the great Hercules and undergo the
greatest toil and trouble for the sake of aiding or
saving the world, if possible, than to live in seclusion,
