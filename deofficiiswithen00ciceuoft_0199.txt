and that, too, philosophers and scholars-—asking position 01 the

duct: for although our school maintains that nothing

can be known for certain, yet, they urge, I make a

habit of presenting my opinions on all sorts of sub-

jects and at this very moment am trying to formulate

rules of duty. But I wish that they had a proper
understanding of 'our position. For we Academi-

cians are not men whose minds wander in uncer-

tainty and never know what principles to adopt.

For what sort of mental habit, or rather what sort

of life would that be which should dispense with all

rules for reasoning or even for living? Not so with

us; but, as other schools maintain that some things

are certain, others uncertain, we, differing with

them, say that some things are probable, others im-

probable,

What, then, is to hinder me from accepting what
seems to me to be probable, while rejecting what
seems to be improbable, and from shunning the
presumption of dogmatism, while keeping clear of
that recklessness of assertion which is as far as
possible removed from true wisdom? And as to the
fact that our school argues against everything, that
is only because we could not get a clear view of
what is “probable,'' unless a comparative estimate
were made of all the arguments on both sides.

But this subject has been, I think, quite fully set
forth in my “Academics.’' And although, my dear
Cicero, you are a student of that most ancient and
celebrated school of philosophy, with Cratippus as
your master—andhe deserves to be classed with the
founders of that illustrious sect1—still Ι wish our
