Editio Princeps: The first edition of the de Officiis
was from the press of Sweynheim and Pannartz
at the Monastery of Subia003 possibly the edi-
tion published by F ust and Schoffer at Mainz is
a little older. Both appeared in 1465. The
latter was the first to print the Greek words in
Greek type. The de Officiis is, therefore, the
first classical book to be issued from a printing
press, with the possible exception of Lactantius
and Cicero‘s de Oratore which bear the more
exact date of October 30, 1465, and were like-
wise issued from the Monastery press at Subiaco.
