circumstance, and age. But there is nothing so
essentially proper as to maintain consistency in the
performance of every act and in the conception of
every plan.

XXXV· But the propriety to which I refer shows ggffissessgtiid'ns

itself also in every dced, in every word, even in every
movement and attitude of the body. And in out-
ward, visible propriety there are three elements—
beauty‚ tact, and taste; these conceptions are difficult
to express in words, but it will be enough for my
purpose if they are understood. In these three
elements is included also our concern for the good
opinion of those with whom and amongst whom we
live. For these reasons I should like to say a few
words about this kind of propriety also.

First of all, Nature seems to have had a wonderful
plan in the construction of our bodies. Our face and
our figure generally, in so far as it has a comely
appearance, she has placed in sight; but the parts
of the body that are given us only to serve the
needs of nature and that would present an unsightly
and unpleasant appearance she has covered up and

concealed from view. Man's modesty has followed Modesty.

this careful contrivance of Nature’s; all right-minded
people keep out of sight what Nature has hidden
and take pains to respond to nature’s demands as
privately as possible3 and in the case of those parts
of the body which only serve nature's needs, neither
the parts nor the functions are called by their real
names. To perform these functions—-if only it be
done in private—is nothing immoral; but to speak

. of them is indecent. And so neither public per-

formance of those acts nor vulgar mention of them
is free from indecency.
