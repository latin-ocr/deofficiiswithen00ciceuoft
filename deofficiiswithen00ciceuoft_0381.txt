BOOK 111. xxi

“ If wrong may e’er be right, for a throne‘s sake
Were wrong most right :—‘be God in all else
feared! '' ³
Our tyrant deserved his death for having made an
exception of the one thing that was the blackest
crime of all. Why do we gather instances of petty
crime—legacies criminally obtained and fraudulent
buying and selling? Behold, here you have a man
who was ambitious to be king of the Roman People
and master of the whole world; and he achieved it!
The man who maintains that such an ambition is Even to gaina
morally right is a madman; for he justifies the de· ξνᾞξξέίξζέἓοω
struction of law and liberty and thinks their hideous expedient.
and detestable suppression glorious. But if anyone
agrees that it is not morally right to be king in a
state that once was free and that ought to be free
now, and yet imagines that it is advantageous for
him who can reach that position, with what remon-
strance or rather with what appeal should I try to
tear him away from so strange a delusion? For, oh
ye immortal gods! can the most liorrible and hideous
of all murders—that of fatherland—bring advantage
to anybody, even though he who has committed
such a crime receives from his enslaved fellow-
citizens the title of ‘⁶ Father of his Country’' ¹³? Identity οἱ
Expediency, therefore, must be measured by the engffissg‘ccfftssffl
standard of moral rectitude, and in such a way, too, m a
that these two words shall seem in sound only to be
different but in real meaning to be one and the same.
What greater advantage one could have, according
to the standard of popular opinion, than to be a king,
I do not know; when, however, I begin to bring the
question back to the standard of truth, then Ι find
nothing more disadvantageous sor one who has risen
