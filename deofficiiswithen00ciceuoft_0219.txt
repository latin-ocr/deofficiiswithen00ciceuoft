of clemency or by only a necessary degree of severity ;
the senate was a haven of refuge for kings, tribes,

to modify even before Sulla’s time3 but since his
victory we have departed from it altogether. For
the time had gone by when any oppression of the
allies could appear wrong, seeing that atrocities so
outrageous were committed against Roman citizens.
In Sulla’s case, therefore, an unrighteous victory
disgraced a righteous cause. For when he had
planted his spearl and was selling under the hammer
in the forum the property of men who were patriots
and men of wealth and, at least, Roman citizens, he
had the effrontery to announce that “he was selling

sign of an auction-sale—a symbol derived from the sale οἱ
