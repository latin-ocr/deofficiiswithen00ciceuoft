tical wisdom; it follows, therefore, that discreet
action is of more value than wise (but inactive)

So much must suffice for this topic. For, in its
essence, it has been made so clear, that in deter-
mining a question of duty it is not difficult to
see which duty is to be preferred to any other.
Moreover‚ even in the social relations themselves
there are gradations of duty so well defined that
it can easily be seen which duty takes prece-
dence of any other: our first duty is to the immor-tal
gods3 our second, to country3 our third, to parents;
and so on, in a descending scale, to the rest.

From this brief discussion, then, it can be under-
stood that people are often in doubt not only whether
an action is morally right or wrong, but also, when
a choice is offered between two moral actions, which
one is morally better. This point, as I remarked
above, has been overlooked by Panaetius. But let us
now nass on to what remains.
