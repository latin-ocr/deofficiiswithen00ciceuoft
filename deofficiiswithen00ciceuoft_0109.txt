BOOK 1. xxiv

for a storm3 a wise man’ s way is, when the storm
does come, to withstand it with all the means at his
command, and especially, when the advantages to
· be expected in case of a successful issue are greater
than the hazards of the struggle.

The dangers attending great affairs of state fall Pa tri otism and
sometimes upon those who undertake them, some· seusa ΗΝ ‘¹⁶⁰⁸‘
times upon the state. In carrying out such enter-
prises, some run the risk of losing their lives, others
their reputation and the good-will of their fellow-
citizens. It is our duty, then, to be more ready to
endanger our own than the public welfare and to
hazard honour and glory more readily than other
advantages.²

Many, on the other hand, have been found who
were ready to pour out not only their money but
their lives for their country and yet would not
consent to make even the slightest sacrifice of per-
sonal glory-——even though the interests of their
country demanded it. For example, when Callicra-
tidas, as Spartan admiral in the Peloponnesian War,
had won many signal successes, he spoiled every·
thing at the end by refusing to listen to the proposal

of those who thought he ought to withdraw his fleet
’ from the Arginusae and not to risk an engagement
with the Athenians. His answer to them was that
,“ the Spartans could build‘another fleet, if they lost
that one, but he could not retreat without dishonour
to himself.” And yet what he did dealt only a
slight blow to Sparta3 there was another which
proved disastrous, when Cleombrotus in sear of criti-
cism recklessly went into battle against Epaminon-
das. In consequence of that, the Spartan power
fell.
