are occupied solely with their own affairs, without
seeming to themselves to be doing anyone any injury.
But while they steer clear of the one kind of injustice,
they fall into the other: they are traitors to social
life, for they contribute to it none of their interest,
none of their effort, none of their means.

Now since we have set forth the two kinds of Rules 01 duty

injustice and assigned the motives that lead to each
and since we have previously established the prin-
ciples by which Justice is constituted, we shall be in
a position easily to decide what our duty on each
occasion is, unless we are extremely sels-centred3 for
indeed it is not an easy matter to be really concerned
with other people’s affairs 3 and yet in Terence’s play,
we know, Chremes “thinks that nothing that concerns
man is foreign to him.” Nevertheless, when things
turn out for our own good or ill, we realize it more
fully and feel it more deeply than when the same
things happen to others and we see them only, as it
were, in the far distanee3 and for this reason we
judge their case differently from our own. It is,
therefore, an excellent rule that they give who bid us
not to do a thing, when there is a doubt whether it
be right or wrong3 for righteousness shines with a
brilliance of its own, but doubt is a sign that we are
thinking of a possible wrong.
