BOOK Ι. xxii

though a great man and a soldier oi extraordinary
ability, did no greater service to the state by destroy-
ing Numantia than was done at the same time by
Publius Nasica, though not then clothed with official
authority, by removing Tiberius Gracchus. This
deed does not, to be sure, belong wholly to the do-
main of civil affairs3 it partakes of the nature of war
also, since it was effected by violence3 but it was, for
all that, executed as a political measure without the
help of an army.

to rail:

“Yield, ye azms, to the toga3 to civic praises‚² ye
laurels.”
Not to mention other instances, did not arms yield
to the toga, when I was at the helm of state? For
never was the republic in more serious peril, never
was peace more profound. Thus, as the result of my
counsels and my vigilance, their weapons slipped
suddenly from the hands of the most desperate
traitors—dropped to the ground of their own accord!
What achievement in war, then, was ever so great?

78 What triumph can be compared with that? F orI
may boast to you, my son Marcus3 for to you belong
the inheritance of that glory of mine and the duty
of imitating my deeds. And it was to me, too, that
Gnaeus Pompey, a hero crowned with the honours
of war, paid this tribute in the hearing of many,
when he said that his third triumph would have been
gained in vain, if he were not to have through my
services to the state a place in which to celebrate
it.

There are, therefore, instanees of civic courage
