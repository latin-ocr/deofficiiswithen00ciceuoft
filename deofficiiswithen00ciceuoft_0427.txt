BOOK III. xxxiii

we can in favour of pleasure, we will grant that it
may contribute something that possibly gives some
spice to life, but certainly nothing that is really ex-
pedient.

121 Herewith, my son Marcus, you have a present conclusion,
from your father—a generous one, in my humble
opinion3 but its value will depend upon the spirit in
which you receive it. And yet you must welcome
these three books as fellow-guests, so to speak, along
with your notes on Cratippus's lectures. But as you
would sometimes give ear to me also, if I had come
to Athens (and I should be there now, if my country
had not called me back with accents unmistakable,
when I was half-way there), so you will please devote
as much time as you can to these volumes, for in
them my voice will travel to you; and you can
devote to them as much time as you will. And
when I see that you take delight in this branch of
philosophy, I shall then talk further with you—at
an early date,a I hope, face to face—but as long as
you are abroad, I shall converse with you thus at a
distance.

Farewell, my dear Cicero, and be assured that,
while you are the object of my deepest affection, you
will be dearer to me still, if you find pleasure in
such counsel and instruction.
