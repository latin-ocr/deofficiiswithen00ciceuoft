whereas, inasmuch as all things morally wrong are
evil, trickery prefers the evil to the good.

It is not only in the case of real estate transfers
that the civil law, based upon a natural feeling for
the right, punishes trickery and deception, but also

the expedient seems to conflict with the right. For
how few will be found who can refrain from wrong-
doing‚ if assured of the power to keep it an absolute
secret and to run no risk of punishment!

and embezzlers of public moneys, who should be
repressed not by lectures and discussions of philoso-

study here the conduct of those who have the repu-
tation of being honest men.
