BOOK ΙΙΙ. xxiii

“Aye, verily3 but it is to our country’ s interest to
have citizens who are loyal to their parents.'’

“But once more—if the father attempts to make
himself king, or to betray his country, shall the son
hold his peace?”

“,Nay verily3 he will plead with his father not to
do so. If that accomplishes nothing, he will take
him to task3 he will even threaten ; and in the end,
if things point to the destruction of the state, he
will sacrifice his father to the safety of his country '’

Again, he raises the question. “If a wise man As mial red bam
should inadvertently accept counterfeit money for byn} osgen es
good, will he offer it as genuine in payment of a An nitpa ater.
debt after he discovers his mistake?'' Diogenes
says “”3Yes Antipaterff ‘''N,o and I agree with
him. “

If a man knowingly offers for sale wine that is
spoiling, ought he tell his customers? Diogenes
thinks that it is not required3 Antipater holds that
an honest man would do so. These are like so
many points of the law disputed among the Stoics.

‘In selling a slave, should his faults be declared—
not those only which the seller 1s bound by the civil
law to declare or have the slave returned to him, but
also the fact that he is untruthful, or disposed to
gamble, or steal, or get drunk?’¹ The one thinks
such facts should be declared, the other does not.

“If a man thinks that he 1s selling brass, when he
is actually selling gold, should an upright man infoim
him that his stuff is gold, or go on buying for one
shilling² what is worth a thousand? '⁹

It is clear enough by this time what my views are
on these questions, and what are the grounds of
dispute between the above-named philosophers.
