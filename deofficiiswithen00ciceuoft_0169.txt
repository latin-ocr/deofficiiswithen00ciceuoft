BOOK I. xxxix-xl

In entering upon any course of action, then,
we must hold fast to three principles: first, that
impulse shall obey reason3 for there is no better
way than this to secure the observance of duties3
second, that we estimate carefully the importance
of the object that we wish to acconiplish, so that
neither more nor less care and attention may be
expended upon it than the case requires; the third
principle is that we be careful to observe moderation
in all that is essential to the outward appearance
and dignity of a gentleman. Moreover, the best
rule for securing this is strictly to observe that
propriety which we have discussed above, and not
to overstep it. Yet of these three principles, the
one of prime importance is to keep impulse sub-
servient to reason.

XL. Next, then, we must discuss orderliness of
conduct and seasonableness of occasions. These two
qualities are embraced in that science which the
Greeks call εὐταξία-Ποῖ that εὐταξία which we
translate with moderation [modestia]‚ derived from
moderate3 but this is the εὐταξία by which we under-
stand orderly conduct. And so, if we may call it
also moderation, it is defined by the Stoics as follows:
“Moderation is the science of disposing aright
everything that is done or said.” So the essence
of orderliness and of right—placing, it seems, will be
the same; for orderliness they define also as “the
arrangement of things in their suitable and appro-
priate places.” By “place of action,'’ moreover,
they mean seasonableness of circumstance3 and the
seasonable circumstance for an action is called in
Greek εὐκαιρία, in Latin occasio (occasion). So it
comes about that in this sense moderation, which we
