BOOK ΙΙ. x

fore Ι am speaking here in the popular sense, when
I call some men brave, others good, and still others
wise3 for in dealing with popular conceptions we
must employ familiar words in their common accepta-
tion; and this was the practice of Panaetius likewise.
But let us return to the subject.

6 The third, then, of the three conditions Ι named (ἕψω-σω]
as essential to glory is that we be accounted worthy ’ᾖῒξαῗζξὲ ξ
of the esteem and admiration of our fellow- men.
While people admire in general everything that· is
great or better than they expect, they admire in par-
ticular the good qualities that they find unexpectedly
in individuals. And so they reverence and extol
with the highest praises those men in whom they
see certain pre-eminent and extraordinary talents;
and they look down with contempt upon those who
they think have no ability, no spirit, no energy. For
they do not despise all those of whom they think ill.
For some men they consider unscrupulous, slander·
ous, fraudulent, and dangerous; they do not despise
them, it may be3 but they do think ill of them.
And therefore, as I said before, those are despise-d
who are “of no use to themselves or their neigh-
bours,'' as the say mg is, who are idle, lazy, and
indifferent.

7 On the other hand, those are regarded with ad-
miration who are thought to excel others in ability
and to be free from all dishonour and also from
those vices which others do not easily resist. For
sensual pleasure, a most seductive mistress, turns the
hearts of the greater part of humanity away from
virtue3 and when the fiery trial of affliction draws
near, most people are terrified beyond measure.
Life and death, wealth and want affect all men most
