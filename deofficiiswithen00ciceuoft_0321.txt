BOOK 111. vi

29 But, perhaps, some one may say: “Well‚ then,
suppose a wise man were starving to death, might
he not take the bread of some perfectly useless
member of society?'' [Not at all; for my life is not
more precious to me than that temper of soul which
would keep me from doing wrong to anybody for my
own advantage] “Or again3 supposing 3 righteous
man were in a position to rob the cruel and inhumari
tyrant Phalaris of clothing, might he not do it to
keep himself from freezing to death?”

30 These cases are very easy to decide. For if merely
for one's own benefit one were to take something away
from a man, though he were a perfectly worthless
feHow, it would be an act of meanness and contrary
to nature's law. But suppose one would be able, Theinterestsot
by remaining alive, to render signal service to the ᾖζξξῗέὃῗζὲζξ
state and to human society—if from that motive one exceptions.
should take something from another, it would not
be a matter for censure. But if such is not the case,
each one must bear his own burden of distress rather
than rob 3 neighbour of his rights. We are not to
say, therefore, that sickness or want or any evil of
that sort is more repugnant to nature than to covet
and to appropriate what is one's neighbour's; but we
do maintain that disregard of the common interests

31 is repugnant to nature; for it is unjust. And there-
fore nature’s law itself, which proteets and conserves
human interests, will surely determine that a man
who is wise, good, and brave, should in emergency
have the neccssaries of life transferred to him from
a person who is idle and worthless ; for the good
man’s death would be a heavy loss to the common
weal3 only let him beware that sels-esteem and
sels-love do not find in such a transfer of possessions
