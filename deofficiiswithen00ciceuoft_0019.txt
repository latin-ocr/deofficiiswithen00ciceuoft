bane in political life naturally led him first to scep-
ticism, then to eclecticism, where his choice is
dictated by his bias for the practical and his scepti-
cism itself disappears from view. And while Antiochus,
the eclectic Academician of Athens, and Posidonius,
the eclectio Stoic of Rhodes, seem to have had the
strongest influence upon him, he draws at his own

letter addressed to his son Marcus (see Index), at this
time a youth of twenty-one, pursuing his university
studies in the Peripatetic school of Cratippus in
Athens, and sowing for what promised to be an
abundant crop of wild oats. This situation gives
force and definiteness to the practical tendencies of
the father’s ethical teachings. And yet, be it ob-
served, that same father is not without censure for
contributing to his son’s extravagant and riotous
living by giving him an allowance of nearly 5:870 a

of the Moral Duties he takes the Stoic Panaetius of
Rhodes (see Index), Περὶ Καθήκοντος, drawing also
from many other sources, but following him more or

dependent and much inferior. He is usually super—
ficial and not always clear. He translates and
