carefully avoid those seemingly trivia] faults which
pass unnoticed by the many. However slightly out
of tune a harp or flute may be, the fault is still
detected by a connoisseur3 so we must be on the
watch lest haply something in our life be out of
tune—nay‚ rather, far greater is the need for pains-

observe others and from a glance of the eyes, from
a contracting or relaxing of the brows, from an air
of sadness, from an outburst of joy, from a laugh,
from speech, from silence, from a raising or lowering

is not a bad plan to judge of the nature of our every
action by studying others, that so we may ourselves
avoid anything that is unbecoming in them. For it

failings more readily than we do our own3 and so

to do better whose faults the masters mimic for the

sake of correcting them.
