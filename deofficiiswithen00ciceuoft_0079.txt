BOOK Ι. xvi

that bond of connection is reason and speech, which
by the processes of teaching and learning, of com-
municating, discussing, and reasoning associate men
together and unite them in a sort of natural frater-
nity. In no other particular are we farther removed
from the nature of beasts3 for we admit that they
may have courage (horses and lions, for example);
but we do not admit that they have justice, equity,
and goodness3 for they are not endowed with reason
or speech.

This, then, is the most comprehensive bond that
unites together men as men and all to all; and
under it the common right to all things that nature
has produced for the common use of man is to be
maintained, with the understanding that, while
everything assigned as private property by the
statutes and by civil law shall be so held as pre-
scribed by those same laws, everything else shall be
regarded in the light indicated by the Greek pro-
verb: “Amongst friends all things in eommon.”a
Furthermore, we find the common property of all
men in things of the sort defined by Ennius3 and
though restricted by him to one instance, the prin-
ciple may be applied very generally:

“Who kindly sets a wand’rer on his way
Does e'en as if he lit another's lamp by his:
No less shines his, when he his friend's hath lit.'’

In this example he effectively teaches us all to bestow
even upon a stranger what it costs us nothing to give.

52 On this principle we have the following maxims:

“Deny no one the water that flows by;'’ “Let
anyone who will take fire from our fire;” “Honest

counsel give to one who is in doubt;'’
