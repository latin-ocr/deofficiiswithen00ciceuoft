buyers and sellers, to employers and employed, and
to those who are engaged in commercial dealings
generally, justice is indispensable for the conduct of
business. Its importance is so great, that not even npnour among
those who live by wickedness and crime can get on ‘¹¹¹²'ss
without some small element of justice. For if a rob-

member of the gang, he loses his standing even in a
band of robbers; and if the one called the “Pirate

he would be either deserted or murdered by his
comrades. Why, they say that robbers even have a
code of laws to observe and obey. And se, because
of his impartial division of booty, Bardulis, the Illyr-
ian bandit, of whom we read in Theopompus,
acquired great power, Viriathus, of Lusitania, much
greater. He actually defied even our armies and
generals. But Gaius Laelius—the one surnamed
‘the Wise’'-in his praetorship crushed his power,
reduced him to terms, and so ehecked his intrepid
daring, that he left to his successors an easy conquest.
Since, therefore, the efficacy of justice is so great
that it strengthens and augments the power even of
robbers, how great do we think its power will be in
a constitutional government with its laws and courts?
