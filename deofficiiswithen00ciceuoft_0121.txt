BOOK I. xxvii

in which we find considerateness and sels—control,

which give, as it were, a sort of polish to life; it
embraces also temperance, complete subjection of

all the passions, and moderation in all things.

Under this head is further included what, in Latin, Propriety
may be called decoruma (propriety); for in Greek

it is called, πρέπον.ἃ Such is its essential nature,

that it is inseparable from moral goodncss3 for what ζ

is proper is morally right, and what is morally right

is proper. The nature of the difference between
morality and propriety can be more easily felt than
expressed. For whatever propriety may be, it is
manifested only when there is pre-existing moral
rectitude. And so, not only in this division of moral
rectitude which we have now to discuss but also in

the three preceding divisions, it is clearly brought out

what propriety is. For to employ reason and speech Propriety and
rationally, to do with careful consideration what· fflssss‘ffma
ever one does, and in everything to discern the

truth and to uphold it-—that is proper. To be
mistaken, on the other hand, to miss the truth‚

to fall into error, to be led astray—that is as
improper as to be deranged and lose one’s mind.

And all things just are proper ; all things unjust,

like all things immoral, are improper.

The relation of propriety to fortitude is similar.
What is done in a manly and courageous spirit seems
becoming to a man and proper; what is done in a
contrary fashion is at once immoral and‘improper.

This propriety, therefore, of which I am speak-
ing belongs to each division of moral rectitude;
and its relation to the cardinal virtues is so close,
that it is perfectly sels-evident and does not require
any abstruse process of- reasoning to see it. For
