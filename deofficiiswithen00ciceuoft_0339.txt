moral rectitude prevai13 and when in friendship
requests are submitted that are not morally right, let
conscience and scrupulous regard for the right take
precedence of the obligations of friendship. In this
way we shall arrive at a proper choice between con-
flicting duties—the subject of this part of our inves-
tigation.

XI. Through a specious appearance of expediency (4) apparent
wrong is very often committed in transactions be·{§¹ig{1⁰ss{20 and
tween state and state, as by our own country in the duft'y tq y
destruction of Corinth. A more cruel wrong was ¹¹ ⁰⁰⁰⁰⁰ ἶν’
perpetrated by the Athenians in decreeing that the
Aeginetans, whose strength lay in their navy, should
have their thumbs cut off. This seemed to be
expedient; for Aegina was too grave a menace, as it
was close to the Piraeus. But no cruelty can be
expedient; for cruelty is most abhorrent to human
nature, whose leadings we ought to follow. They,
too, do wrong who would debar foreigners from
enjoying the advantages of their city and would
exclude them from its borders, as was done by
Pennus in the time of our fathers, and in recent
times by Papius. 'It may not be right, of course,
for one who is not a citizen to exercise the rights and
privileges of citizenship3 and the law on this point
was secured by two of our wisest consuls, Crassus and
Scaevola. Still, to debar foreigners from enjoying
the advantages of the city is altogether contrary to
the laws of humanity.

There are splendid examples in history where the Moralright
apparent expediency of the state has been set at ζῖἓζξζξξίἕω
naught out of regard for moral rectitude. Our own expediency
country has many instances to offer throughout her
history, and especially in the Second Punic War
