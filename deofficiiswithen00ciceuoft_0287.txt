BOOK II. xxiv

85 Those, then, whose office it is to look after the
interests of the state will refrain from that form of
liberality which robs one man to enrich another.
Above all, they will use their best endeavours that Administration
every one shall be protected in the possession of his Ῐῖξ ξξῖῑῖῗης
own property by the fair administration of the law
and the courts, that the poorer classes shall not be
oppressed because of their helplessness, and that
envy shall not stand in the way of the rich, to prevent
them from keeping or recovering possession of what
justly belongs to them ; they must strive, too, by what-
ever means they can, in peace or in war, to advance
the state in power, in territory, and in revenues.

Such service calls for great men3 it was commonly
rendered in the days of our aneestors3 if men will
perform duties such as these, they will win popu-
larity and glory for themselves and at the same time
render eminent service to the state.

86 Now, in this list of rules touehing expediency, Sanitation.
Antipater of Tyre, a Stoic philosopher who recently
died at Athens, claims that two points were over-
looked by Panaetius—the care of health and of
property. I presume that the eminent philosopher
overlooked these two items because they present no
difficulty. At all events they are expedient. Al-
though they are a matter of course, I will still say a
few words on the subject. Individual health is pre-
served by studying one's own constitution, by observ-
ing what is good or bad for one, by constant self-
control in supplying physica} wants and comforts
(but only to the extent necessary to sels-preserva-
tion), by foregoing sensual pleasures‚ and finally, by

the professional skill of those to whose science these
matters belong.
