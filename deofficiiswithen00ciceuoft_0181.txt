perance) it 1s often necessary in deciding a question of
duty that these virtues be weighed against one another.
153 My view, therefore, is that those duties are closer Justx ¹0⁰
to nature which depend upon the social instinct Wi sdo om
than those which depend upon knowledge; and this
view can be confirmed by the following argument.
(1) suppose that a wise man should be vouchsafed
such a life that, with an abundance of everything
pouring in upon him, he might in perfect peace
study and ponder over everything that is worth
knowing, still, if the solitude were so complete that
he could never see a human being, he would die.
And then, the foremost of all virtues is wisdom—what
the Greeks 0311 σοφίας for by prudence, which they
0311 φρόνησις, we understand something else, namely,
the practical knowledge of things to be sought for ’
and of things to be avoided. (2) Again‚ that wisdom
which I have given the foremost place is the know-
ledge of things human and divine, which 1s concei ned
also with the bonds of union between gods and men
and the relations of man to man. If wisdom is the
most important of the virtues, as it certainly is, it
necessarily follows that that duty which is connected
with the social obligation is the most important duty.a
And (3) service is better than mere theoretical know-
ledge, for the study and knowledge of the universe
would somehow be lame and defective, were no practi-
cal results to follow. Such results, moreover, are best
seen in the safe-guarding of human interests. It is
essential, then ,to human society ; and it should, there-

fore, be ranked above speculative knowledge.
instinct the place from which wisdom has been shunted.
Cicero could not refrain from introducing 3 bit of
theoretical speculation that has no value for his practical
position—it actually prejudices it and confuses the reader.
