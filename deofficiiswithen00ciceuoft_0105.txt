that are not inferior to the courage of the soldier.
Nay, the former calls for even greater energy and
greater devotion than the latter.

moral, not by physical, strength. And yet the body
must be trained and so disciplined that it can obey
the dictates of judgment and reason in attending
to business and in enduring toil. But that moral
goodness which is our theme depends wholly upon
the thought and attention given to it by the mind.

And in this way, the men who in a civil capacity

ξ, direct the affairs of the nation render no less impor-

ἒ tant service than they who conduct its wars: by their
statesmanship oftentimes wars are either averted or
terminated3 sometimes also they are declared. Upon
Marcus Cato’s counsel, for example, the Third Punic
WVar was undertaken, and in its conduct his influence

80 was dominant, even after he was dead. And so
diplomacy in the friendly settlement of controversies
is more desirable than courage in settling them on
the battlefield3 but we must be careful not to take
that course merely for the sake of avoiding war
rather than for the sake of public expediency. War,
however, should be undertaken in such a way as to
make it evident that it has no other object than to
secure peace.

But it takes a brave and resolute spirit not to be
disconcerted in times of difficulty or ruffled and
thrown off one's feet, as the saying is, but to keep
one’s presence of mind and one's sels-possession and
not to swerve from the path of reason.

381 Now all this requires great personal courage ; but c0urage and
it calls also for great intellectual ability by reflection discretion.
