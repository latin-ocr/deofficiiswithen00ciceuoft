whether an action is morally right or morally wrong,
but also, when a choice of two morally right courses
is offered, which one is morally better3 and likewise,
when a choice of two expedients is offered, which one
is more expedient. Thus the question which Panaetius
thought threefold ought, we find, to be divided into
