great advantage, too, for those who wish to obtain a
powerful political influence by honourable means to
be able through their social relations with their
guests to enjoy popularity and to exert ‚influence
abroad. For an instance of extraordinary hospi-
tality‚ Theophrastus writes that at Athens Cimon
was hospitable even to the Laciads‚ the people of
his own deme3 for he instructed his bailiffs to that
end and gave them orders that every attention
should be shown to any Laciad who should ever call
at his country home.

XIX. Again, the kindnesses shown not by gifts
of money but by personal service³ are bestowed
sometimes upon the community at large, sometimes
upon individual citizens. To protect a man in his
legal rights [‚to assist him with counsel,] and to serve
as many as possible with that sort of knowledge
tends greatly to increase one’s influence and popu-
larity.

Thus, among the many admirable ideas of our
ancestors was the high respect they always accorded to
the study and interpretation of the excellent body
of our civil law. And down to the present unsettled
times the foremost men of the state have kept this
profession exclusively in their own hands3 but now
the prestige of legal learning has departed along
with offices of honour and positions of dignity3 and
this is the more deplorable‚ because it has come to
pass in the lifetime of a manb who in knowledge of
the law would easily have surpassed all his prede-
cessors, while in honour he is their peer. Service
such as this, then, finds many to appreciate it and is

calerilated to bind people closely to us by our good
services.
