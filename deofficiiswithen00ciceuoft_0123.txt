BOOK Ι. xxvii-xxviii f

there is a certain element of propriety perceptible
in every act of moral rectitude3 and this can be
separated from virtue theoretically better than it
can· be practically. As comeliness and beauty of
person are inseparable from the notion of health,
so this propriety of which we are speaking, while
in fact completely blended with virtue, is mentally
and theoretically distinguishable from it.

⁴ The classification of propriety, moreover, is two- grgprigty
sold: (1)we assume a general sort of propriety, which e Μ ”
is found in moral goodness as a whole; then (2)
there is another propriety, subordinate to this, which
belongs to the several divisions of moral goodness.
The former is usually defined somewhat as follows:
f‘Propriety is that which harmonizes with man’s
superiority in those respects in which his nature
differs from that of the rest of the animal creation.”
And they so define the special type of propriety
which is subordinate to the general notion, that
they represent it to be that propriety which
harmonizes with nature, in the sense that it
manifestly embraces temperance and self-control,
together with a certain deportment such as becomes
a gentleman.

XXVIII. That this is the common acceptation of Poetiq
propriety we may infer from that propriety which pr⁰p²¹e¹y‘
poets aim to secur-e. Concerning that, I have occa-
sion to say more in another connection. Now,
we say that the poets observe propriety, when every
word oi· action is in accord with each individual
character. For example, if Aeacus or Minos said:

“Let them hate, if only they fear,’'
or:

“The father is himself his ch.³¹.dren's tomb,’'
