BOOK 111. viii

VIII. Now when we meet with expediency in expediency and
some specious form or other, we cannot help being :ffssssrssffisse
influeneed by it. But if upon closer inspection one
sees that there is some immorality, connected with
what presents the appearance of expediency, then γ
one! is' not necessarily to sacrifice expediency but
to recognize that there can be no expediency where
there is innnorality. But if there is nothing so
repugnant to nature as immorality (for nature
demands right and harmony and consistency and
abhors their opposites), and if nothing is so
thoroughly in accord with nature as expediency,
then surely expediency and immorality cannot co-
exist in one and the same object.

Again: if we are born for moral rectitude and if 'lfhe nporassy
that is either the only thing worth seeking, as Zeno ξζῗέἑᾶῗεξιξο
thought, or at least to be esteemed as infinitely out-
weighing everything else, as Aristotle holds, then it
necessarily follows that the morally right is either
the sole good or the supreme good. Now, that
which is good is certainly expedient3 consequently,
that which is morally right is also expedient.

Thus it is the error of men who are not strictly Theevilsresult-
upright to seize upon something that seems to be ing “0¹3¹ 0⁰¹¹·
expedient and straightway to dissociate that from “ary vnew.
the question of moral right. To this error the
assassin's dagger, the poisoned cup, the forged wills
owe their origin3 this gives rise to theft, embezzle-
ment of public funds, exploitation and plundering
of provincials and citizens3 this engenders also the
lust for excessive wealth, for despotie power, and
finally for making oneself king even in the midst of
a free peo 'le; and anything more atrocious or repul-
sive than {neh a passion> cannot be conccived. For
