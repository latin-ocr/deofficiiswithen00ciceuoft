these problems, if conducted by those who consider
whatever is morally right also expedient and nothing
expedient that is not at the same time morally right,
will be more illuminating than if conducted by those
who think that something not expedient may be
morally right and that something not morally right
may be expedient. But our New Academy allows
us wide liberty, so that it is within my right to
defend any theory that presents itself to me as most
'probable. But to return tomy rule.

V. Well then, for a man to take something from Wrongfpigains
his neighbour and to profit by his neighbour's loss is lagggfannst ²¹²⁶
more contrary to nature than is death or poverty or (1) 0¹ nature,
pain or anything else that can affect either our per-
son or our property. For, in the first place, injus-
tiee is fatal to social life and fellowship between man
and man. For if we are so disposed that each, to
gain some personal profit, will defraud or injure his
neighbour, then those bonds of human society, which
are most in accord with nature's laws, must of
necessity be broken. Suppose, by way of compari-
son, that each one of our bodily members should con-
ceive this idea and imagine that it could be strong
and well if it should draw off to itself the health and
strength of its neighbouring member, the whole
body would necessarily be enfeebled and die3 so, if
each one of us should seize upon the property of his
neighbours and take from each whatever he could
appropriate to his own use, the bonds of human
society must inevitably be annihilated. For, without
any conflict with nature’s laws, it is granted that
everybody may prefer to secure for himself rather
than for his neighbour what is essentia] for the con-
duct of life; but nature's laws do forbid us to increase.
