agreed that they should all appear together upon
the rostra in the afternoon to publish it. And while
all the rest withdrew, some in one direction, some

the council chamber to the rostra and published
individually what had been drawn up by all together.

erected; before these incense and candles burned.
In a word, no one ever enjoyed greater popularity

himself alone all the credit with the people; but to
secure by that means his electim to the consulship,
which was then the goal of his ambition,b seemed

have one rule, with which I desire you to be per-
fectly familiar: that which seems expedient mus!
